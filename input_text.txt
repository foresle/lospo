When I die, bury me
Me on the grave,
Among the wide steppe,
In Ukraine, dear,
To deer wide fields,
And the Dnieper, and the cliffs
It was seen, it was heard,
How roaring roaring.
How to bear from Ukraine
In the blue sea
I guess the blood ... I'm gone
Both deer and mountains -
I will leave everything and wormwood
To God himself
Pray ... and before that
I don't know God.
Bury and get up,
Break the shackles
And the enemy with evil blood
Sprinkle the will.
And me in a big family,
In a free, new family,
Don't forget to mention
A kind quiet word.
